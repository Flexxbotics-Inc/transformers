# transformers
This repository is home to open source transformers that are compatible with FlexxCore within the Flexxbotics platform. Things that you can find in the repository include: 

-2 examples of equipment transformers (**Universal Robot and Haas NextGen Control CNC**) 
-A base **Template** for creating your own transformer
-An example of creating a **Workcell Transformer** which embeds multiple transformers to do things like reconcile workcell state, perform automatic restarts, perform threaded controls, and many more advanced capabilities.
-An example of creating a **Script** which is callable from the Flexxbotics HMI controls configurator.
